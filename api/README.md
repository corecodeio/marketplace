This is the backend of the Core Code Platform system.

## 1. Content

Controller backend of our user frontend (student-app) and management frontend (management-app). The project is carried out in:

-   Node.js

-   express.js

-   sequelize (with Postgres database)

## 2. Necessary programs

To be able to use the project in localhost it is necessary to clone and have some programs:

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) v18.12.1 Higher.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) PostgreSQL (can be optional, sequelize
    allows you to configure other databases).
- Development IDE of your convenience Example [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for APIS testing. (Optional)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be able to manage the versions.

## 3. How to clone

As the project is in a workspaces we will clone everything:

```bash
cd existing_folder
git clone https://github.com/corecodeio/platform.git

```

## 4. Installation 

As the project is in a workspace we will install the dependencies of all the projects locating ourselves in the main directory or if we want only the backend positioning ourselves in "/api":

```bash
npm install
```

## 5. Private keys
We will create a file called .env positioned in "/api"

- Server configurations: these variables are for basic configuration and development mode.
    - SERVER_PORT: api project execution port
    - SERVER_MODE: variable to run development mode, should be filled with the value "dev" (if you use the console, it will display additional data when an endpoint is triggered and preload the information from the "development-data" folder to the database ).
    - SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_USER: are the variables to customize the USER and STAFF registry of the development mode. If these variables are not created, the user for development mode by default will be:
    ```json
    {
        "email" : "testing@gmail.com",
        "password" : "123456"
    }
    ```
    -SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_COURSE: they are the variables to create a default course and you can make testing easier without having to create channels repeatedly
```bash
    #Server configurations
    SERVER_PORT=3001
    SERVER_MODE=
    #User / Staff Testing
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_USER_FIRST_NAME=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_USER_LAST_NAME=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_USER_COUNTRY=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_USER_EMAIL=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_USER_PASSWORD=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_USER_PHONE=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_USER_SLACK_ID=
    #Course Testing
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_COURSE_NAME=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_COURSE_SLACK_ID=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_COURSE_NAME_SLACK=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_COURSE_CALENDAR_ID=
    SERVER_DEVELOPMENT_COURSE_CALENDAR_NAME=
```

- Database configurations: These variables are for the connection to the database, the api project is configured to use Postgresql with the "sequelize" ORM.
```bash
    #Database configurations
    SERVER_DB_USER=
    SERVER_DB_PASS=
    SERVER_DB_HOST=
    SERVER_DB_PORT=
    SERVER_DB_NAME=
```

- Frontend configurations:: URLs needed to configure cors and email links.
```bash
    #Frontend configurations
    CLIENT_STUDENT_URL=http://localhost:3500
    CLIENT_MANAGEMENT_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

- Jsonwebtoken configuration: variables for creating tokens.
```bash
    #jwt configurations
    JWT_SECRET_KEY_STUDENT=
    JWT_EXPIRES_STUDENT=
    JWT_SECRET_KEY_MANAGEMENT=
    JWT_EXPIRES_MANAGEMENT=
```

- Nodemailer configurations: necessary for sending mail with the nodemailer library.
If you use a google mail the NODE_MAILER_HOST is "smtp.gmail.com" and its port is 587.
You can also avoid using your private email password by creating an application password:
![Image](../src/images/password-app.jpg)
```bash
    #nodemailer configurations
    NODE_MAILER_HOST=
    NODE_MAILER_PORT=
    NODE_MAILER_USER=
    NODE_MAILER_PASSWORD=
```

- Slack configurations: variable necessary for the socket connection of our slack app.
if SERVER_MODE_SLACK is filled with "dev" the console logs additional data
```bash
    #slack configurations
    SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_TOKEN=
    SLACK_APP_LEVEL_TOKEN=
    SERVER_MODE_SLACK=
```

- Google calendar configuration: variable needed for connection with google api.
```bash
    #google configurations
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
    GOOGLE_SECRET_CLIENT=
    GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=
```

## 6. Run en producción:

Eliminate the "SERVER_MODE" key and change the others to those corresponding to the production environment.
When the keys are in production mode, execute the command:

```bash
npm run start
```
In case of being positioned in the central directory of the workspaces use:

```bash
npm run start:api
```

## 7. Slack app configuration

- In order to configure the SLACK environment variables, we must first create an application at https://api.slack.com/ and install it in our slack workspace.

- Before we can install the application we must create permissions.

- Enable socket connection mode.

- We generate our application level token for the environment variable SLACK_APP_LEVEL_TOKEN.

- we copy the user Oauth Token to the environment variable SLACK_BOT_USER_OAUTH_TOKEN
